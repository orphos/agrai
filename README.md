# Agrai
Agrai is a collection repository of various example/experimental/incubational code.

# Why not Gist, or GitLab Snippets or something like that?
- Gist does not have directories;
  We want to put our experimental code under single, organized directory tree.
  In addition to that some build systems require directory to work.
- URL of Gist looks like https://gist.github.com/{username}/{sha1sum}.
  We want to give somewhat  meaningful name to our code.

# Etymology
From ἄγραι, plural form of ἄγρα (Ancient Greek "hunting").
